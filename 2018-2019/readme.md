# Web Engineering (2018-2019) 
Louis Minsky - lminsky@packer.edu  
Room G076  

### Course Description
In this class students will explore the various technologies that make the internet work. They'll start by creating simple web pages with HTML and will eventually add in CSS and Javascript. They'll learn what a server is, and how they can create one to host a website of their own. They'll learn about the technologies that form the backbone of the web, such as DNS, HTTP, and databases, along with what differentiates the web from the internet as a whole. Student will leave with the ability to better understand one of the most ubiquitous fields in computer science.

### Texts & Software
We will be using the book HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites, by Jon Duckett thoughout the course. Any other material will be distributed either as a handout or posted online. 

### Grading
Your grade will be calculated as a fraction of the total points available. You may revise homework up to one week after it is returned for a grade up to a 90. Late homework will not get above an 80. You will receive a point for participation each day. Things you could do to not earn that point include, but are not limited to, skipping class, playing games, wearing headphones.
